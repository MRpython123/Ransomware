# Ransomware
**DISCLAIMER: DO NOT USE IN ANY MALICIOUS PURPOSES!!!**
This software encodes all the files up to a directory reffered to as "original" will be encoded, if a user runs the encr.py script, and decodes after running the decr.py file.
First of all, what directory do we call "original". For example, let's imagine that the victim has run the encr.py file on his computer in the directory "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop". The original directory will here is the one that user (attacker) chooses. All the files, with a path that contains the complete path of the original directory in it, will be encrypted recursively. Here we need to say that in the majority of cases of using the ransomware, you want to leave everything as default so that all the files on a disk are encrypted (with the original directory "C:\").
